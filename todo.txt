I'm wondering if I should add the deps to the home page or through my
deps-managing-system. I think I should use the system. Or I could load them by
default, and register them in the system

-> add the default assets to the home.html;
-> register them on the :init! handler
-> copy assets to the resources folder

- navbar

- home page
  > logged out: feed
  > logged in: feed
  > logged out / in: landing page

- blog
  > blog posts
  > blog post

- ecommerce:
  > store page
  > product page

- profile page

- admin dashboard ?
